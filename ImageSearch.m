%% ImageSearch.m
% ImageSearch.m perform an image search to find images contained within a
% directory that are similar to a specified image.
%
% To use this script place it into the same directory as your project code
% that you have written. You will then be able to run it from that
% directory.
%
% Note: This script calls many of your Image Fingerprint project functions,
% so you must have working versions to use this script.
%
% For convenience you may like to add the directory containing your code
% to the Matlab path, which will allow your code to be run from other
% directories as well. This can be done by setting the current folder to
% the one that contains your project files, then you can right click on the
% directory containing your code and choose:
% add to path > selected folders
%
% If you added your code directory to the path it can be convenient
% to change into the directory containing the images you want to search
% through and then run this script from that directory by typing
% ImageSearch (this will save you having to specify the directory to
% search as you can then hit enter to use the current directory).
